  ]
]

#section-slide([ Let's get started! ])

#slide(title: [ The basics ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - A Typst document is a *markup* with *code*
    - The markup is the default mode or when surrounded in `[` and `]`.
    - The `#` character is used to switch to code mode.
    ```typ
      This is markup
      #this-is-code()
      #[ This is also markup ]
    ```
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ The basics (cont.) ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - Heading levels are defined with `=` characters ```typ
      = Heading 1
      == Heading 2
      === Heading 3
    ```
    - Lists are defined with `-` characters ```typ
      - Item 1
      - Item 2
        - Item 2.1
    ```
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ The basics (cont.) ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - Numbered lists are defined with `+` characters ```typ
      + Item 1
      + Item 2
        + Item 2.1
    ```
    - Strong emphasis is done with `*` and `_` characters ```typ
      *This is strong*
      _This is emphasized_
    ```
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ The basics (cont.) ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - You can create labels using the `<label>` syntax: ```typ
      = Chapter 1 <my-label>
    ```
    - And you can reference them using the `@` syntax: ```typ
      @my-label // This creates a clickable link
    ```
    - It works the same for bibliographies! ```typ
      @my-bib-entry // This creates a clickable link
    ```
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ The basics (cont.) ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - You can insert comments using `//` and `/* */` ```typ
      // This is a comment
      /* This is a block comment */
    ```
    - You can insert code using the `#` character ```typ
      #let x = 1
      #let y = 2
      #let z = x + y
    ```
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ The basics (cont.) ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - You can insert a block of code using the `#` character ```typ
      #{
        let x = 1
        let y = 2
      }
    ```
    - You can declare functions and variables using the `let` keyword ```typ
      #let add(a, b) = a + b
      #let c = add(5, 6)
    ```
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ Bibliographies ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - Please use *Zotero* for managing your bibliographies
    - You can export your bibliography to a `.bib` file
    - Or you can use *Hayagriva*'s `.yaml` files
    - You can then import them in your Typst document ```typ
      #bibliography("my-bibliography.bib", style: "ieee")
    ```
    - You can then cite them using the `@` syntax ```typ
      @my-bib-entry // Will display like [1] and be clickable.
    ```
    - Everything will be formatted automatically!
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ Images and figures ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - You can insert images using the `#image` function ```typ
      #image("my-image.png")
    ```
    - And wrap them in a figure using the `#figure` function ```typ
      #figure(caption: "My caption")[
        #image("my-image.png")
      ] <my-image>
    ```
    - It automatically detects the type of figure (image, table, etc.)
    - You can reference it by giving it a label and referecing it using the `@` syntax.
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ Equations ])[
  - Two types: inline and display
  #line-by-line[
    - Inline equations are surrounded by `$` characters: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ ```typ
      $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$
    ```
    - Display equations are surrounded by `$` characters with a space:  $ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $ ```typ
      $ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $
    ```
    - You can also give them a label and reference them.
    - Syntax is similar to LaTeX but with a few differences.
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ Outlines & queries ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - Outlines are built from a query
    - Queries allow you to ask questions of your document ```typ
      #locate(loc => {
        query(heading.where(level: 1), loc)
      })
    ```
    - And are made easy to use ```typ
      #outline(target: figure.where(kind: image))
    ```
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ Packages ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - Packages are a way to extend Typst
    - They are written in Typst itself
    - They are easy to import ```typ
      #import "@preview/polylux:0.3.1": *
    ```
    - And easy to use ```typ
      #show: codly-init.with()
      #codly()
    ```
    - Downloaded on demand
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ `show` rules, and `set` commands ])[
  #line-by-line[
    - `show` rules are used to change how an object is displayed ```typ
      #show link: it => text(color: blue, it)
      #link("https://www.google.com/") will be blue.
    ```
    - `set` commands are used to change the state of a function ```typ
      #set text(font: "New Computer Modern")
      This text will be in New Computer Modern.
    ```
    - Rules are applied in order of appearance
    - Rules are scoped to the current block
  ]
]

#slide(title: [ Nifty packages ])[
  - `@preview/polylux` for making slides (like this one)
  - `@preview/codly` for beautiful code blocks
  - `@preview/cetz` for creating diagrams
  - `@preview/tablex` for creating beautiful tables
  - `@preview/glossarium` for creating glossaries
  - `@preview/lemmify` and `@preview/ctheorems` for creating theorems
  - `@preview/jogs` to run JS code
  - `@preview/pyrunner` to run Python code from Typst
  - So many more
